# Data Moves for Making Sense of Height Estimations

At an activity posted at estimation180.com, students are asked to estimate the height of the man in this picture:

![](estimation180_man_height.jpg)

In considering the height, students are asked to give

-   a lower limit (what would be a lower bound for the man's height)
-   upper limit (what would be an upper bound for the man's height)
-   a specific estimate for the height
-   provide a rationale for their estimate

## Load Required Packages
```{r}
library(conflicted)
library(skimr)
library(psych)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(knitr)

conflicts_prefer(dplyr::lag)
conflicts_prefer(dplyr::filter)

options(scipen = 999, digits = 2)
```


## Import and Examine Data

```{r}
height_est <- read_csv("Day 01 Height Estimates from Fergussen.csv")
```

```{r}
skim(height_est)
```
```{r}
height_est <- height_est |>
  mutate(Timestamp = mdy_hms(Timestamp)) |>
  clean_names() |>
  filter(!(is.na(whats_too_low) & is.na(whats_too_high) & is.na(your_estimate)))
```


```{r}
glimpse(height_est)
```


## Sample Data

```{r}
set.seed(557)

height_est_sample <- height_est |>
  slice_sample(n = 200)
```

```{r}
glimpse(height_est_sample)
```
