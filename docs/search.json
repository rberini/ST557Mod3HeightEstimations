A significant portion of the height estimates remained in a format which could not be confidently converted to a numeric value in a common unit.\nThe following code blocks use a simpler, although less defensible approach, of ignoring the various unit designations, and instead just extracting the numbers and using reasonable ranges to approximate the intended unit. This allowed me to move forward in my analysis. The below therefore is indicative of some steps I would have taken if I could have eventually coerced at least the “your_estimate_mod” column into a usbale state.\n\nheight_est_sample_mod_2 &lt;- height_est_sample_mod |&gt;\n  mutate(estimate_cm = map_dbl(your_estimate, function(text) {\n    if (is.na(text) || str_trim(text) == \"\")\n      return(NA_real_)\n    \n    numbers &lt;- as.numeric(str_extract_all(text, \"\\\\d+\\\\.?\\\\d*\")[[1]])\n    if (length(numbers) == 0)\n      return(NA_real_)\n    \n    tryCatch({\n      first_num &lt;- numbers[1]\n      \n      if (first_num &lt; 3) {\n        conv_unit(first_num, \"m\", \"cm\")\n      } else if (first_num &gt; 100) {\n        first_num\n      } else if (first_num &gt;= 50 && first_num &lt;= 100) {\n        conv_unit(first_num, \"inch\", \"cm\")\n      } else if (first_num &gt;= 3 && first_num &lt; 9) {\n        if (length(numbers) &gt;= 2 && numbers[2] &lt;= 12) {\n          conv_unit(first_num, \"ft\", \"cm\") + conv_unit(numbers[2], \"inch\", \"cm\")\n        } else {\n          conv_unit(first_num, \"ft\", \"cm\")\n        }\n      } else if (first_num &gt;= 9 && first_num &lt; 50) {\n        conv_unit(first_num, \"inch\", \"cm\")\n      } else {\n        NA_real_\n      }\n    }, error = function(e)\n      NA_real_)\n  }))\n\nGet summary statistics for height estimate\n\ndescribe(height_est_sample_mod_2$estimate_cm)\n\n   vars   n mean sd median trimmed mad min max range skew kurtosis  se\nX1    1 199  187 20    188     188 7.5  23 250   227 -3.1       25 1.4\n\n\nCompare with trimmed mean\n\nmean(height_est_sample_mod_2$estimate_cm, trim = 0.1, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 188\n\n\nVisualize distribution of height estimates\n\nheight_est_sample_mod_2 |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(estimate_cm)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = estimate_cm)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = \"#CC0000\") +\n  labs(title = \"Histogram of Height Estimates (cm)\", x = \"Height Estimate (cm)\", y = \"Frequency\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(text = element_text(family = \"Roboto\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualize with boxplot to better consider outliers\n\nheight_est_sample_mod_2 |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(estimate_cm)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(y = estimate_cm)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"#CC0000\") +\n  labs(title = \"Boxplot of Height Estimates (cm)\", y = \"Height Estimate (cm)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(text = element_text(family = \"Roboto\"))"

A significant portion of the height estimates remained in a format which could not be confidently converted to a numeric value in a common unit.\nThe following code blocks use a simpler, although less defensible approach, of ignoring the various unit designations, and instead just extracting the numbers and using reasonable ranges to approximate the intended unit. This allowed me to move forward in my analysis. The below therefore is indicative of some steps I would have taken if I could have eventually coerced at least the “your_estimate_mod” column into a usbale state.\n\nheight_est_sample_mod_2 &lt;- height_est_sample_mod |&gt;\n  mutate(estimate_cm = map_dbl(your_estimate, function(text) {\n    if (is.na(text) || str_trim(text) == \"\")\n      return(NA_real_)\n    \n    numbers &lt;- as.numeric(str_extract_all(text, \"\\\\d+\\\\.?\\\\d*\")[[1]])\n    if (length(numbers) == 0)\n      return(NA_real_)\n    \n    tryCatch({\n      first_num &lt;- numbers[1]\n      \n      if (first_num &lt; 3) {\n        conv_unit(first_num, \"m\", \"cm\")\n      } else if (first_num &gt; 100) {\n        first_num\n      } else if (first_num &gt;= 50 && first_num &lt;= 100) {\n        conv_unit(first_num, \"inch\", \"cm\")\n      } else if (first_num &gt;= 3 && first_num &lt; 9) {\n        if (length(numbers) &gt;= 2 && numbers[2] &lt;= 12) {\n          conv_unit(first_num, \"ft\", \"cm\") + conv_unit(numbers[2], \"inch\", \"cm\")\n        } else {\n          conv_unit(first_num, \"ft\", \"cm\")\n        }\n      } else if (first_num &gt;= 9 && first_num &lt; 50) {\n        conv_unit(first_num, \"inch\", \"cm\")\n      } else {\n        NA_real_\n      }\n    }, error = function(e)\n      NA_real_)\n  }))\n\nGet summary statistics for height estimate\n\ndescribe(height_est_sample_mod_2$estimate_cm)\n\n   vars   n mean sd median trimmed mad min max range skew kurtosis  se\nX1    1 199  187 20    188     188 7.5  23 250   227 -3.1       25 1.4\n\n\nCompare with trimmed mean\n\nmean(height_est_sample_mod_2$estimate_cm, trim = 0.1, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 188\n\n\nVisualize distribution of height estimates\n\nheight_est_sample_mod_2 |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(estimate_cm)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = estimate_cm)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = \"#CC0000\") +\n  labs(title = \"Histogram of Height Estimates (cm)\", x = \"Height Estimate (cm)\", y = \"Frequency\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(text = element_text(family = \"Roboto\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualize with boxplot to better consider outliers\n\nheight_est_sample_mod_2 |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(estimate_cm)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(y = estimate_cm)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"#CC0000\") +\n  labs(title = \"Boxplot of Height Estimates (cm)\", y = \"Height Estimate (cm)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(text = element_text(family = \"Roboto\"))"
